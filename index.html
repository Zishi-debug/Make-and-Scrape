        <h1>Week 3: Data Scrape</h1>
        <p>
          I want to do something about the sexuality in the culture of anime and manga. I scratched images and text from "anime","otaku","avatar","platonic love","pervertive","male gaze". 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I dig into the cuteness in character, I find it is hard to ignore the sexuality behind it. I call it the male gaze in anime and manga culture.Different from the male gaze in
            Hollywood movies, it is not just sexual desire for female character , there is also a  kind of palatonic love to godness and idol. There are three factor in this otaku sexuality:"dehumanization",
            "the absence of real sex", "the absence of others".
            As for the the absence of real sex, it is a kind of sex based on images and virtual world and characters.
            I am not sure how to use computational technologies to explore this concept, but basically I want to create a parallel universe just like the twisted world in "living with a mysterious gril".
